# Rauner College Prep - Detention Sign-Off Web Application (2017 STEM Project)
At a time when money is scarce in Chicago schools, Serina is interested in saving her school time and money by moving several paper oriented tasks to the web. Serina is developing a web application to do just that. 
This application allows students and parents to view and approved their detentions all electronically thus reducing the need to bring home detention slips to have your parents sign off.

This web app was created by Serina Rodriguez (HS Class of 2017) and Keith Salette (Mentor)
